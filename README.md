# Adevent of Code
Using this to learn [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). Many thanks to [@gahjelle](https://github.com/gahjelle/advent_of_code/tree/main/elixir) and [@mathsaey](https://github.com/mathsaey/adventofcode) for demonstrating how to structure an Elixir project and for offering idiomatic solutions to the problems.

I use the test scripts to print the solutions. Don't peek at the test files if you don't want to see the numerical answers.
